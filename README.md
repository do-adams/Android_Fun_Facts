# Android_Fun_Facts
A charming little fact-telling app for Android.

![Android Fun Facts](/Fun Facts.png?raw=true)

Built between March and April 2016, during the time I completed the [Build a Simple Android App](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-simple-android-app-2) 
and [Android Activity Lifecycle](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/android-activity-lifecycle) courses at [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/),
this was a great project to get me introduced to the Android framework. 

The app makes use of onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState methods to save View data in-between configuration changes, and
chooses a fact at (pseudo) random to display to the user when requested.
